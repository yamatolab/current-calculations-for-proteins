What is CURP for?
============================

CURrent calculation for Proteins (CURP) permits to compute energy/heat currents and atomic stress tensors in a protein, given atomic coordinates and velocity trajectories obtained through molecular dynamics (MD).

Flow diagram of CURP calculations
=================================

 The CURP program is designed for the analysis of (1) energy/heat current during vibrational energy relaxation and (2) atomic stress tensors or the flow of linear momenta in the thermally fluctuating protein media. The flowchart of the CURP calculation procedure is shown below.
