TERMS and CONDITIONS:
 Yamato Laboratory, Nagoya University (hereinafter referred  to
as "Yamato Lab") has developed the computational tool  for  the
analysis of the following physical properties of proteins:  (1) 
the atomic stress tensor and (2) the vibrational  energy  flow.
 The computational tool  is  referred  to  as  "CURP"  (CURrent 
calculation for Proteins), which includes the set  of  programs
and the manuals. CURP is provided to a person who shall  comply
with the following Terms and Conditions ("Person" here  can  be 
an  individual,  an  institution  or  a corporation   and    is 
hereinafter referred to as the "user".).

 The use of (A) CURP, (B) copied or modified CURP and (C)  CURP
incorporated into another software by the user is permitted for
the user's own purposes. If the user wishes to use CURP  for  a 
third party, the  user  should  contact Yamato Lab directly  in
advance.

PUBLICATION OF RESULTS
 The user must indicate that CURP was  used  in  the  following
cases: 

(1) when the user publishes a result obtained by using (A) CURP
(B) copied or modified CURP or (C)  software incorporating CURP
(2) when the user publishes a modified part of CURP.

NO WARRANTY
CURP is provided as is, and Yamato  Lab  does  not  warrant  or
guarantee the quality, performance, or any outcomes obtained by
running CURP for the  user.  The  user  agrees  that  the  user  
downloads, saves or uses CURP on user's own responsibility  and
if any problem occurs through downloading, saving or using CURP,
the user  shall  be responsible for all consequences, including
compensation to any third party.

VIOLATION of the TERMS and CONDITIONS
 If the user breaches the Terms and Conditions, CURP (including
copied or modified CURP) must be uninstalled  from  the  user's
machine.
